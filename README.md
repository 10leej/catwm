Summary
-------

catwm is a very simple and lightweight tiling window manager.

Status
------

 * 24.02.10 -> First release, v0.1. In this release 0.1, the wm is almost functional


Modes
-----

It allow the "normal" modes of tiling window managers:

    --------------
    |        |___|
    |        |___|
    | Master |___|
    |        |___|
    |        |___|
    --------------

and fullscreen mode

There is no horizontal stack because I never use it. But if someone is interested in, it's very easy to add.

Installation
------------

Need Xlib, then:
    $ vim config.h
    $ make
    # make install
    $ make clean

Todo
----
 * Correct some "minor" bugs
 * Cleanup some parts of the code
 * Allow to change master size
 * Add multiple view ("desktop")

If you have some particular request, just send me an e-mail, and I will see for it!
